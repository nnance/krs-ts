Recommendation System Example - TypeScript

A significant part of Credit Karma's platform is identifying well-matched
financial offerings for our users based on many factors including a user's
current financial profile. For this test you'll be asked to develop a
rudimentary system that does exactly that.

The goal of the system is to serve offers to users. You'll develop this
in a stepwise manner. Whenever you're asked to serve an offer to the user
the implementation should result in the offers being printed to the console.

Step 1: Return all of the offers from each service to the user.
Step 2: Only return offers from each service where the user's credit score
        is between (inclusive) the offers minimum and maximum score.
Step 3: Serve all relevant offers from step 2 and only the auto loan offers to the user if the following conditions
        are true: (a) The user's credit score is within the offer's range
        (b) The user's current outstanding loan is less than or equal to
        the auto loan offer's high limit (maximumAmount).

This data is here as a reference. Itâ€™s not required that you
deserialize the data, but it is required that you somehow
represent the offers in your program to print them to the console.
